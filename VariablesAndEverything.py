Tuple:
This is a type of data structure which is similar to list but the values in a tuple 
are constant .
"""

"""
Dictionary:
This is a type of data structure where the values are referenced with a key (#Hash)
"""
# dic_variable = {}
# dict_variable = {'Name': 'Alex', 'Address': 'Mumbai', 'Mark': 90}
# var = {key:value,key:value,key:value}

# print(dict_variable.keys())
# print(dict_variable.values())
"""

take the above user input and put in it in a dict {name:value,age:value,address:value}
